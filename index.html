    <p>QNS Collaborative, a communal art space, local business hub and aspiring community organizing center, saw a gap and decided to fill it. Located on Astoria Boulevard, QNS Collaborative opened its brick and mortar in October 2021.</p>

<p>“A big reason that we love Queens collab is like, we’re just trying so hard to make the space accessible for people who just want to try things out,” said Sarah Clive, a member of the organizing and community outreach committee of QNS in Astoria. “We’re trying to make it much more accessible to the masses.”</p>

<p>It occupies the space that once was Earth & Me, a sustainable goods shop owned and operated by Kayli Kunkel, on Astoria Blvd. QNS, in collaboration with Kunkel, gained ownership of the space in October 2021.</p>

<p>QNS is a “worker cooperative” first and foremost, and that looks different depending on what the members deem necessary at the moment. Currently, it serves as a one-stop-shop showcasing local artists. With the upcoming holidays, the collaborative has opted to participate in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shopsmallastoria/?hl=en"> Shop Small Astoria </a>, an initiative that supports small businesses by incentivizing residents to shop locally. “We try to ensure that there’s both geographic diversity from all around Queens, and we tried to give priority to like BIPOC and differently-abled makers,” said Maryam Shariat-Mudrick.</p>

<p>The space is primarily filled with colorful handmade ceramic mugs, earrings, stationery and clothing. Artists pay a monthly fee, on a sliding scale, for their spot in the collaborative with a 70/30 consignment fee. The organization is fully self-funded, so this way the local artists and QNS are able to make a profit according to Shariat-Mudrick.</p>

<p>However, the space isn’t solely made up of artists. Community partners such as <a href="https://therollinglibrary.com/"> The Rolling Library </a>, a mobile book fair providing free books across the city, provided a reading corner and free books in the store. Kaleidospace and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/queensliberationproject/?hl=en"> Queens Liberation Project </a>, both of which engage with the borough’s Black, Latinx and Asian-American communities through community care and art, contribute to the space as well.</p>

<p>These partnerships set QNS apart from other businesses. “I don’t think you’re going to go into another store in Astoria, and be able to get a zine about Black women’s labor and maternal mortality in the Black community, right?” said Shariat-Mudrick. “So just being able to make physical space for those conversations is a really important component of our values.”</p>

<p>For QNS, this focus on local artists is a way to get community members interested in the idea of a collective, communal space. “We’ve had people come in and say, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m an artist, too. How do I get involved?’” said Clive. That Sunday, two customers approached Clive asking to use QNS to host dance classes and an animal adoption event.</p>

<p>“We’re really excited to have the opportunity and the privilege to experiment in this way,” said Shariat-Mudrick. “We’re excited to see where the road leads.”</p>
